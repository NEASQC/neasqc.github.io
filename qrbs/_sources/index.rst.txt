    This is the documentation page for the Quantum Rule-Based System (QRBS) software library of `NEASQC project <https://neasqc.eu>`_ (WP6).

    If this is your first time around here, you might want to check out the :doc:`installation guide<install>`.

    We also have some examples of :doc:`basic<basic_usage>` and :doc:`advanced<advanced_usage>` usage of the library, as well as the :doc:`documentation<neasqc_qrbs>` of all the elements in each module.
