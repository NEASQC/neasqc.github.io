    Documentation of the QLM library *Quantum Quantitative Finance Library* **QQuantLib** associated to the use case of *Financial Applications* of Work Package 5 **WP5.3** (**Machine Learning & Optimisation** use cases) of the NEASQC european project.

    **QQuantLib** is a python library containing following packages:

    1. **QQuantLib/DL**: This is the *Data Loading* package which contains modules related to the loading of the data.
    2. **QQuantLib/AA**: This is the *Amplitude Amplification* package which contains modules related with amplitude amplification operators.
    3. **QQuantLib/AE**: This is the *Amplitude Estimation* package which is devoted to different amplitude amplification algorithms.
    4. **QQuantLib/PE**: This is the *Phase Estimation*  package which contains modules for phase estimation algorithms that can be used in amplitude estimation procedure. 
    5. **QQuantLib/utils**: This package contains auxiliar modules used for all the beforementioned pacakges.
